# Supply_Chain_Final
For our final we analyzed a publicly available dataset showing grouped transaction records of 2160 products across a million rows. The data was grouped and cleaned by month. We then created a python script to apply multiple forecasting methods, including exponential smoothing and regression to track accuracy. Data was then merged back into the original dataset for use in a tableau dashboard.
