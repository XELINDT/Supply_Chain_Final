# Supply_Chain_Final
For our final we analyzed a publicly available dataset showing grouped transaction records of 2160 products across a million rows. The data was grouped and cleaned by month. We then created a python script to apply multiple forecasting methods, including exponential smoothing and regression to track accuracy. Data was then merged back into the original dataset for use in a tableau dashboard.
/n Cleaning and prepping code II: contains code that was use to clean the data and then analyze it. Forecasting methods used were exponential smoothing (alpha was optimized uniquely for every product), regression and rolling average.
/n Supply Chain Dashboard 1 and 2: Contain screen shots of the dashboard for 2 of 2160 products
